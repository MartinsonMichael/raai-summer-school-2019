## Demo solution of Hackathon 1. “Computer vision and reinforcement learning”

### Task description

In the modern world, the creation of smart roads and smart cities through which unmanned vehicles drive is being actively researched.
Driving a car in autonomous mode through a crossroad is one of the objectives of such research. Obtaining information about the traffic situation at the crossroad is possible using sensors installed on the car, and information from external systems. Such an external system can be an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), hovering above the crossroad and having the possibility of reliable recognition of road users.
The task of planning the movement of an autonomous vehicle through such an crossroad can be solved either on the basis of pre-programmed scenarios or using a prospective approach based on deep reinforcement learning.
A special and high role in the development, debugging and research of artificial intelligence systems using computer vision and reinforcement learning methods is played by computer simulators.
The solution of the hackathon task involves working with an crossroad simulator created in the laboratory of cognitive dynamic systems of MIPT based on a UAV video and creating the best quality algorithm for driving an autonomous car through an crossroad without collisions with other vehicles.

### Benefits from participation
- Learn how to prepare data for training of neural networks that detect objects and highlight them along the contour.
- Learn to apply the reinforcement learning approach to traffic planning.
- Learn how to work with popular deep learning libraries Keras and Tensorflow for solving computer vision tasks and pyTorch for reinforcement learning.
- Learn how to debug a Python program on a server with GPU on video cards with support for Nvidia CUDA technology.
- Develop a prototype of program to control the unmanned vehicle at the crossroad.
- The winners of the hackathon will have the opportunity to undergo an internship at the Laboratory of Cognitive Dynamic Systems of MIPT, as well as give an advantage in entering the new master's program “Methods and Technologies of Artificial Intelligence”, which opens in 2019 at MIPT.
